display_name: Lookup Processor
type: lookup

description: |
  The lookup processor enriches telemetry signals by performing external lookups to retrieve additional data. It
  evaluates an [OTTL](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/pkg/ottl/README.md) value
  expression to extract a lookup key, queries a lookup source, and writes the results as new attributes.

  Currently supports logs, with metrics and traces support planned.
