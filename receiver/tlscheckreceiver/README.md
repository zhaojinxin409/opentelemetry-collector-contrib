Emit metrics about x.509 certificates.

## Getting Started

By default, the TLS Check Receiver will emit a single metric, `tlscheck.time_left`, per target. This is measured in seconds until the date and time specified in the `NotAfter` field of the x.509 certificate. After certificate expiration, the metric value will be a negative integer measuring the time in seconds since expiry.

## Example Configuration

Targets are configured as a remote endpoint accessed via TCP, a PEM-encoded certificate file stored locally on disk, or a Java-format keystore file (JKS or PKCS#12).

```yaml
receivers:
  tlscheck:
    targets:
      # Monitor a local PEM file (default when no file_format is set)
      - file_path: /etc/istio/certs/cert-chain.pem

      # Monitor a JKS keystore — format inferred from .jks extension
      - file_path: /opt/app/keystore.jks
        password: changeit

      # Monitor a PKCS#12 keystore — format inferred from .p12 extension
      - file_path: /opt/app/keystore.p12
        password: ${env:KEYSTORE_PASSWORD}

      # Explicit format override (e.g. a .ks file that is actually JKS)
      - file_path: /opt/app/keystore.ks
        file_format: jks
        password: changeit

      # Monitor a remote endpoint
      - endpoint: example.com:443

      # Monitor a local service with a custom timeout
      - endpoint: localhost:10901
        dialer:
          timeout: 15s
```

### Configuration Fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `file_path` | string | | Path to a certificate file on disk. Mutually exclusive with `endpoint`. |
| `file_format` | string | `auto` | Format of the certificate file. One of: `auto`, `pem`, `jks`, `pkcs12`. When `auto`, the format is inferred from the file extension (`.jks` → JKS; `.p12` / `.pfx` → PKCS#12; all others → PEM). |
| `password` | string | | Password for JKS or PKCS#12 keystores. The value is masked in logs and diagnostic output. Optional for unprotected JKS files. |

### JKS Keystores

JKS files may contain multiple aliases. One `tlscheck.time_left` metric is emitted per leaf certificate found:

- **TrustedCertificateEntry** — the single certificate stored in the entry is used.
- **PrivateKeyEntry** — the first certificate in the chain (the leaf) is used.

## Certificate Verification

This component does not provide hostname, validity period, path, or CRL / OCSP verification on the certificate.

## Certificate File Validation

If a certificate file specified in the configuration does not exist or is unable to be opened, an error will be logged on each scrape cycle and the `otelcol_scraper_errored_metric_points` metric will be incremented. If you would like to monitor for the existence of specific certificate files on disk, consider using the [File Stats receiver](../filestatsreceiver/README.md).

## Metrics

Details about the metrics produced by this receiver can be found in [metadata.yaml](./metadata.yaml).
