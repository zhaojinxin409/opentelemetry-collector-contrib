  The `extension.sumologic.updateCollectorMetadata` feature gate has been replaced with an
  `update_metadata` configuration parameter. The feature is now enabled by default, eliminating
  the need for users to specify the `--feature-gates` flag. Users can control this behavior via
  the YAML configuration:

  ```yaml
  extensions:
    sumologic:
      update_metadata: true  # default: true
  ```

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [user]
