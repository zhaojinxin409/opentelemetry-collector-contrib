  When `api_version` is empty or omitted, the Docker client now automatically negotiates
  the highest mutually supported API version with the daemon using `WithAPIVersionNegotiation()`.
  Existing configurations with an explicit `api_version` continue to work unchanged.
  Note: The previous default behavior pinned the API version to 1.44 when not specified.
  Now it auto-negotiates with the daemon, which may result in a different API version being used.

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
