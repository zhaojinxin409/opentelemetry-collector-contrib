  The service.instance.id attribute is a deterministic UUID v5 derived from server address and port.
  The database attribute has been moved from a resource attribute to a metric-level attribute (db.namespace) on all per-database metrics, following OpenTelemetry semantic conventions.
  This produces a single resource per MongoDB server instead of one per database, fixing Prometheus batching compatibility.
